# Releasing r2kit

This checklist is for maintainers. It keeps the crate, Git tag, changelog, and
GitHub release tied to the same reviewed commit.

## Prepare the release commit

1. Confirm or update the version in `Cargo.toml` and run `cargo check` so
   `Cargo.lock` records the same package version.
2. Move the relevant entries from `[Unreleased]` into a dated release section
   in `CHANGELOG.md` and update its comparison links.
3. Confirm the README's installation examples use the crates.io version being
   released and that its status notice matches the release state.
4. Run `./scripts/release-check.sh`. It requires a clean worktree, runs the
   complete offline quality suite, and verifies the exact package that Cargo
   would upload.
5. Commit the release changes, push them to `main`, and wait for every required
   CI job to pass.

Live tests are deliberately separate because they need bucket-scoped secrets.
Before a release that changes R2 behavior, run the contract and stress commands
documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` against the dedicated test bucket.

## Publish

Publishing is intentionally not automated by the check script. A crates.io
version cannot be deleted after publication; it can only be yanked.

From the clean, reviewed release commit:

```sh
cargo login
./scripts/release-check.sh
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "r2kit 0.1.0"
cargo publish --locked
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Create a GitHub release titled `r2kit <version> — Safe Cloudflare R2 transfers
for Rust` from that tag. Lead with the installation command and release value
proposition, then copy the matching changelog section into its notes. Confirm
the version is visible on crates.io and its docs build is available on docs.rs;
only then set the repository homepage to the live docs.rs URL.

If `cargo publish` fails, fix the release commit and recreate the **local** tag.
Never push the tag before crates.io accepts the package.

## After publishing

Keep the empty `[Unreleased]` section, verify the README links, and start
collecting changes for the next release.
